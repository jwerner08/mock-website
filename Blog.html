                50 Ways to Leave Your Lover is a tune written by Paul Simon that was released in December of 1975. It was
                the second single off of his second studio album titled: “Still Crazy After All These Years.” One of the
                most recognizable parts of this song is the intro drums which were written by Steve Gadd. Although 50 Ways
                to Leave Your Lover showcases a very recognizable linear style drum beat, the opening harmony is also a very
                notable part of the song. Utilizing 3rd’s, 5th’s, 7th’s, b2’s, and 6th’s, the opening harmony moves and
                creates tension in a way that compliments the song’s theme. Through the verses Paul Simon writes poetically
                about another woman’s advice on how to leave and get over a relationship. The verses are centered around E
                minor which creates a sense of sadness while the woman prepares to give advice, while the choruses are
                centered in G major creating a more happy and uplifted atmosphere around the woman’s advice. A lot of
                what’s talked about in this song, whether it be the verses or choruses is the want to be free from this
                relationship and sadness that he’s holding onto. Musically, the contrast of E minor in the verses and G
                major in the choruses helps tie the song together in a way that shows the mental frameworks and perspectives
                people often hold when leaving a lover. The authenticity of the song comes right after Simon’s divorce with
                his first wife, and is highly popular because of its relatability and the songwriting that has been put
                into the song.
